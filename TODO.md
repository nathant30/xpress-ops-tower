# üõ°Ô∏è Security Hardening TODO - Xpress Ops Tower

**Status:** üü° IN PROGRESS (30% Complete) - **PAUSED FOR FEATURE DEVELOPMENT**  
**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL for production ridesharing/emergency system  
**Target:** 95%+ hardening for 10,000+ drivers + life-critical SOS alerts

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT SAFETY GUIDE

### ‚úÖ **SAFE TO WORK ON** (Won't break existing functionality)
- **Frontend components** - All React components are safe to modify
- **UI/UX improvements** - Styling, layouts, user experience
- **New features** - Adding new pages, components, or functionality  
- **Mock data updates** - `src/lib/mockData.ts` is safe to modify
- **Configuration** - Environment variables, build configs
- **Documentation** - README, comments, etc.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **PROCEED WITH CAUTION** (Test thoroughly)
- **API routes** - Existing `/api/*` endpoints work but lack security
- **Database queries** - Direct database calls (if any) should be tested
- **Authentication flows** - Login/logout may have partial implementation

### üö´ **DO NOT MODIFY** (Will break in-progress security work)
- `src/lib/database/` - Database layer being rebuilt
- `src/lib/security/` - Security utilities in active development  
- `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Authentication hook being enhanced
- **Package dependencies** - Already updated, don't change versions

### üìã **CURRENT STATE SUMMARY**
- ‚úÖ **TypeScript errors fixed** - Project compiles cleanly
- ‚úÖ **Dependencies updated** - All packages current with security patches
- ‚úÖ **Security infrastructure** - Core security utilities created but not integrated
- üîÑ **Database layer** - Partially implemented (repositories 33% done)
- ‚ùå **API security** - Not yet implemented (still uses mock data)
- ‚ùå **Authentication** - Frontend hook exists, API endpoints missing

---

## üî¥ UI/UX FIXES NEEDED

### **Passenger Profile View Fix**
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Passenger profile view layout does not match the driver profile view layout
  - Current passenger profile has different structure/styling than driver profile
  - Need to duplicate the exact driver profile layout and adapt for passenger-specific data
  - Driver profile shows proper full-width layout with correct header, summary card, and tab content
  - Passenger profile currently shows different layout structure
  - Both profiles should have identical UI structure (only data should differ)
  - Layout, styling, spacing, and visual structure must be identical
