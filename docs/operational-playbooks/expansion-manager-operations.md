## Role Overview

### Expansion Manager Responsibilities
- **Region Lifecycle Management**: Manage regions from prospect ‚Üí pilot ‚Üí regional manager handover
- **Pre-launch Configuration**: Configure pricing, supply campaigns, and vendor partnerships
- **Market Intelligence**: Analyze market conditions with masked PII data
- **Vendor Onboarding**: Coordinate vendor partnerships and onboarding processes
- **Handover Orchestration**: Ensure smooth transition to regional managers

- ‚ùå **Cannot Access**: Active/suspended regions, PII unmasking, payroll, HR records
- ‚úÖ **Can Access**: Prospect/pilot regions, masked market data, vendor pipeline
- üîí **Dual-Control Required**: Prelaunch pricing, region promotion, supply campaigns

## Standard Operating Procedures

### 1. New Region Request (T-11)

**Process Flow:**
1. expansion_manager submits region request via API
2. System validates expansion scope (prospect regions only)
3. Request routed to executive approval
4. Upon approval, region created in 'prospect' state

**Required Fields:**
- `region_name`: Descriptive name
- `country_code`: ISO country code  
- `timezone`: IANA timezone identifier
- `justification`: Business case (minimum 100 characters)

**Approval Timeline:** 3-5 business days

### 2. Region Promotion Workflow (T-15)

**State Transitions:**
- `prospect` ‚Üí `pilot`: expansion_manager + executive approval
- `pilot` ‚Üí `active`: regional_manager + executive approval  
- `active` ‚Üí `suspended`: executive + compliance approval only

**Dual-Control Requirements:**
- **Primary Approval**: expansion_manager initiates
- **Secondary Approval**: executive (level 60+) required
- **Expiry**: 24 hours for approval completion

### 3. Prelaunch Configuration (T-13)

**Configuration Areas:**
- **Pricing Models**: Base fare, per-km rate, time-based pricing
- **Supply Campaigns**: Driver acquisition, vehicle onboarding
- **Market Intelligence**: Competitor analysis (masked data only)

**Security Controls:**
- All configurations flagged for dual-control approval
- No direct modification of active region pricing
- Audit trail required for all changes

### 4. Regional Manager Handover

**Handover Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Pilot operations stable for 14+ days
- ‚úÖ Supply targets achieved (min 50 active drivers)

- ‚úÖ Operational readiness checklist complete

**Handover Process:**
1. expansion_manager publishes go-live checklist
2. Regional manager accepts handover request
3. System transfers region ownership
4. Handover duration metrics recorded

## Dual-Control Escalation Paths

### Standard Escalation (Regional Manager Blocks Promotion)

**Scenario**: Regional manager refuses to accept pilot ‚Üí active promotion

**Escalation Path:**
1. **L1 (0-24 hours)**: expansion_manager discusses with regional_manager
2. **L2 (24-48 hours)**: Operations manager mediates (level 25+)
3. **L3 (48-72 hours)**: Executive arbitration (level 60+)
4. **L4 (72+ hours)**: CEO final decision with compliance review

**Arbitration Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Technical readiness (infrastructure, systems)
- ‚úÖ Operational readiness (staffing, processes)  
- ‚úÖ Financial viability (unit economics, projections)
- ‚úÖ Compliance requirements (regulatory, legal)

### Emergency Escalation

**Scenario**: Critical expansion security violation or operational incident

**Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes):**
1. Security team automatically notified (SEV-2 alert)
2. expansion_manager access temporarily suspended
3. Incident commander assigned
4. Executive stakeholders alerted

**Investigation Process:**
1. **Evidence Collection**: Audit logs, system traces, user actions
2. **Impact Assessment**: Affected regions, data, users
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Technical and procedural failures
4. **Remediation Plan**: Immediate and long-term fixes

### Approval Workflow Deadlock Resolution

**Common Deadlock Scenarios:**
- Executive unavailable for secondary approval
- Regional manager disputes handover readiness
- Compliance objects to vendor partnership

**Resolution Matrix:**

| Scenario | Primary Escalation | Secondary Escalation | Final Authority |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Executive Unavailable** | Deputy executive (level 55+) | Board member | CEO |
| **Regional Manager Dispute** | Operations manager | Executive | CEO + Compliance |
| **Compliance Objection** | Legal counsel | External auditor | Board + Legal |
| **Technical Issues** | Engineering manager | CTO | CEO |
